            "answer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.\n\nAI can be categorized into two main types:\n\n1. Narrow or Weak AI: Systems designed for a specific task (like voice assistants or image recognition)\n2. General or Strong AI: Systems with generalized human cognitive abilities\n\nModern AI applications use techniques like machine learning, where systems learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed for each task."

            "answer": "In our application, there are two ways to process files:\n\n**Offline Processing:**\n- Files are processed locally on your device\n- Only file paths are sent to the API\n- Faster processing and better privacy\n- Ideal for sensitive documents\n\n**Online Processing:**\n- Files are uploaded to the server for processing\n- Requires stable internet connection\n- May provide more advanced processing features\n- Better for complex analysis tasks\n\nYou can switch between these modes in the settings dialog. The default is offline processing for better privacy."
