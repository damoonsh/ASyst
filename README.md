# Agentic RAG

## Overview

Agentic RAG is a modern chat application that combines conversational AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. The project features a clean, intuitive interface for users to interact with AI models while leveraging document knowledge for enhanced, context-aware responses.

## Key Features

### ü§ñ **Multi-Model Chat Interface**
- Support for multiple AI models (TinyLlama, Qwen, SmoLLM2)
- Real-time streaming responses with typing animations
- Message editing and conversation history
- Thread-based conversation management

### üìö **Document-Enhanced Responses**
- PDF document upload and processing
- RAG integration for context-aware answers
- Vector database storage for efficient document retrieval
- Automatic document ingestion and indexing

### üèóÔ∏è **Robust Architecture**
- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with modern UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for data persistence
- **Database**: SQLite for conversation storage
- **ID Management**: Backend-generated UUIDs for all entities

### üí¨ **Advanced Conversation Features**
- Lazy thread creation (threads created only when messages are sent)
- Message editing with version history
- Session persistence and management
- Mock and real API modes for development

## Architecture Highlights

- **Backend-Controlled ID Generation**: All thread, message, and edit IDs are generated by the backend using UUIDs
- **Lazy Resource Creation**: Threads are created only when users send their first message
- **Clean API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper separation of concerns
- **State Management**: React Context for session and conversation state
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with dark/light mode support

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI Integration**: Support for multiple LLM providers
- **Document Processing**: PDF parsing and vector embeddings

This project demonstrates best practices in full-stack development, API design, and AI integration, making it an excellent foundation for building production-ready conversational AI applications.
